## [v0.5.0] - 2026-03-24

###Major Update: Production Readiness & Architectural Refactoring

This release transforms the system into a robust, "Modular Monolith" with a professional-grade technical foundation and containerized orchestration.

---

### Added

- Programmatic Migration Engine: Integrated a migration CLI to handle database schema evolution.

- Versioned Schema Control: Added up (apply changes) and down (rollback changes) migration scripts to ensure all team members and environments (Docker/CI) stay in sync.

- Migration History: The system now tracks applied migrations in a migrations metadata table, preventing duplicate executions.

- Many-to-Many (M-M) Fan-out: Implemented the subscriptions join table to allow a single pipeline to broadcast data to multiple subscribers simultaneously.

- Docker Orchestration: Full Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml integration for a one-click "API + Worker + DB" environment.

- Generic Data Access Layer (DAL): Implemented genericQueries.ts to abstract PostgreSQL CRUD operations, reducing boilerplate across all modules.

- Global Error Strategy: - Custom AppError class for operational error handling.

- catchAsync utility to eliminate repetitive try/catch blocks.

- Environment Validation: Integrated Zod-based validation for .env variables at startup.

- Graceful Shutdown: Implemented SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers to ensure the PostgreSQL pool closes cleanly and the worker finishes its heartbeat before exiting.

- Audit Trail: Expanded the deliveries table to log granular HTTP status codes and response bodies for every egress attempt.

### Fixed

- Relational Integrity: Updated SQL schema with ON DELETE CASCADE and strict Foreign Key constraints.

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-03-19
### Docker & CI/CD
- Added **Docker & Docker Compose** support for API, worker, Postgres, and Redis
- CI/CD GitHub Actions workflow added:
  - Builds TypeScript
  - Spins up Postgres + Redis
  - Seeds test pipeline, subscriber, and job
  - Runs worker
  - Verifies jobs processed successfully
- No formal test files required; workflow acts as **functional smoke test**

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Major Update: Async Job & Pipeline Processing

This release upgrades the system from a simple webhook receiver to a full **asynchronous pipeline processing system**.

---

### Added

#### Subscribers Module
- Added `subscribers` table
- Ability to attach multiple subscriber URLs per pipeline
- Dynamic webhook delivery system

#### Jobs / Events Module
- Added `events` table for async job processing
- Stores payload, status, retry attempts, and errors
- Introduced job lifecycle: `pending → processing → success / failed`

#### Worker System
- Background worker (`worker.ts`) processes jobs every 2 seconds
- Applies pipeline actions dynamically
- Sends processed results to subscribers

#### Action Engine
- Implemented pipeline actions:
  - `log`
  - `uppercase`
  - `reverse`
- Dynamic execution based on pipeline configuration

#### Retry Mechanism
- Job retry up to 3 attempts
- Subscriber retry up to 3 attempts per endpoint
- Delay between retries
- Error tracking and logging

- Added `events` table
- Deprecated `webhooks` table (now used only for testing/legacy)

---

### Improvements
